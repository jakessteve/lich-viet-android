# SKILL: Technical Writing

**Trigger:** When @ba or any agent creates documentation — PRDs, briefs, research reports, meeting notes, glossaries, or any SOT document.

---

## When to Use
- Creating any document that will be read by others (human or agent).
- Writing PRDs, research reports, or architecture documentation.
- Drafting user-facing content (help docs, feature guides).
- Reviewing existing documentation for quality and clarity.
- Creating SOT (Source of Truth) documents.

---

## Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity First
- **Short, direct sentences.** Avoid jargon unless defined in `GLOSSARY.md`.
- **One idea per paragraph.** One purpose per document.
- **Active voice:** "The system validates input" not "Input is validated by the system."
- **Specificity:** "Reduces load time by 40%" not "Significantly improves performance."

### 2. Structure for Scanning
People scan documents, they don't read them linearly:
- Start with an **Executive Summary** — the reader should get 80% of the value from the first paragraph.
- Use **headers** (H2, H3) to create a navigable table of contents.
- Use **bullet points** for lists of 3+ items.
- Use **tables** for comparisons and structured data.
- Use **bold** for key terms on first use.
- Use **code blocks** for any technical values, commands, or file paths.

### 3. Consistency
- Use consistent terminology — define terms in `GLOSSARY.md`.
- Use consistent date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Use consistent status labels: `Draft → Review → Approved → Final`.
- Use consistent file naming: `kebab-case-document-name.md`.

## Quality Checklist
Before finalizing any document:

| Check | Why |
|---|---|
| Clear title, date, and author | Traceability |
| Understandable without prior context | Accessibility |
| All acronyms defined on first use | Clarity |
| Formatting consistent (headers, lists, code) | Professionalism |
| Spell-checked and grammar-checked | Quality |
| Links verified (not broken) | Usability |
| Action items have owners and due dates | Accountability |
| Version number if iterative doc | Change tracking |

## Rules
- **Start with `documentation-style-guide`** for brand voice, terminology, and bilingual standards.
- **Every document needs a purpose.** If you can't state it in one sentence, the doc is unfocused.
- **Date everything.** Undated documents are unreliable.
- **Prefer tables over prose** for structured data and comparisons.
- **Link, don't duplicate.** Reference existing docs instead of copying content.
- **Review before publishing.** Use the quality checklist above.
